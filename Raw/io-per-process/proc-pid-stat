42: delayacct_blkio_ticks  %llu  (since Linux 2.6.18)
        Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock ticks
        (centiseconds).

(36) nswap  %lu
        Number of pages swapped (not maintained).


(24) rss  %ld
        Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
        in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
        toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
        include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,
        or which are swapped out.


(22) starttime  %llu
        The time the process started after system boot.  In
        kernels before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed
        in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed
        in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).


(19) nice  %ld
   The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the
   range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

(20) num_threads  %ld
        Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
        Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as
        a placeholder for an earlier removed field.


(14) utime  %lu
        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
        in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
        sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time,
        guest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
        below), so that applications that are not aware of
        the guest time field do not lose that time from
        their calculations.

(15) stime  %lu
        Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
        in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
        sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).

(10) minflt  %lu
        The number of minor faults the process has made
        which have not required loading a memory page from
        disk.

(12) majflt  %lu
        The number of major faults the process has made
        which have required loading a memory page from disk.
